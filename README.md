This algorithm uses linked-chains - extremely helpfull tool.

This project can be a very nice tutorial to learn how to use them.

As of the algorithm, its two functions will sort the stacks better than the Radix Sort, which is commonly used to pass this project.

For 100 numbers stacks, the highest roll possible is below 700 instructions for 10.000 tests :

Here : Best = 515 ||| Worst = 675 ||| Average = 590 ||| Standard Deviation = 18.6

For 500 numbers stacks, the highest roll possible is below 5500 instructions for 10.000 tests :
